# CrimeAnaliticTools
Statistical methods for studying criminal activity using artificial intelligence (AI)

The package “CrimeanaliticTools” contains functions for a forensic analysis of crimes data, including their exploration analysis and preliminary preparation, some functions for simplifying the use of artificial intelligence methods.

In particular, the package contains the following functions:
Dixon, Grubbs and Irvin test to identify outliers;
computes the area under the curve (AUC), AUC variance and the confidence interval (CI) of AUC;
calculates a cross-tabulation of observed and predicted classes with associated statistics;
variable importance using Garson's and Olden's algorithm, and sensitivity analysis using Lek's profile method for input variables for a Multi-layer Perceptron classifier or regressor;
assessment of the relative importance of features in data for estimator;
search for the best combination of features in data using ensemble methods;
for to draw a Multi-layer Perceptron classifier or regressor in image.
